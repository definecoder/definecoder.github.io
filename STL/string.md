# String

To use string first of all you have to add this header **` #include <string> `**

## Declaring and Initializing a String 
It is very easy to declare a string. You can create a string variable nammed as MyString by typing **` string MyString ; `**

You can declare several string togather in a line. You can also _**initialize**_ a string using **` string MyString = "Hello World!" `**. 
You can also do that later in your code.

You can take a string from the user using **` cin >> MySting ; `** which only takes the string _**up to a space**_

If you want to get _**a full line including spaces**_ use this instead  **` getline( cin , MyString ) ; `**

## Basic Sting Operations

Lets say you have two strings **` string a = "Hello " , b = "World" ; `** You can add string **b** after string **a** using **` a = a + b `**
after this opatertion the value of a will be **"Hello World"**. 
That is how you can **concatenate** two strings.

You can delete last charecter on a sting using **` MyString.pop_back() `**

As you know string is an array of charecters so you can access any index (0 to length-1) and change that in constant time. _e.g:_ **` MyString[0] = 'h' ; `**

You can print a string using **` cout << MyString << endl ; `**

You can check the equality of two strings using  **` strA == strB `** and inequality using **` strA != strB `** . 
You can also check which string is lexicographically greater using **` strA > strB `** vice versa.

## String Functions :

|         Function        |                              Work of the function                              |
|:-----------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|     MyString.size()     |                         Returns The size of the string                         |
|     str1.swap(str2)     |                        Swaps the value of str1 and str2                        |
|   MyString.insert(x,s)  |                     Inserts s in the xth index of MyString                     |
|     MySrting.find(s)    | returns initial index of first occurrence of the s in MyString else returns -1 |
|    MySrting.rfind(s)    |  returns initial index of last occurrence of the s in MyString else returns -1 |
| MyString.replace(i,j,s) |       Replaces j characters from ith index of MyString with new string s       |
|      stoi(MyString)     |                 Returns the integer converted form of MyString                 |
|   MyString.substr(i,k)  |            Returns a substing of length k from ith index of MyString           |
|    MyString.erase(i)    |           Erases every element from ith index to the end of MyString           |
|     MyString.clear()    |                        Erases every element in MyStirng                        |
|     MyString.empty()    |              Returns True if  MyString is empty else return false              |
